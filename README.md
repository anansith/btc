# btc_prediction_final.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains the final implementation of a Bitcoin price trend prediction model. Price changes are separated into three signals: **Buy**, **Hold**, and **Sell**.  The classification is based on the percentage change of the next day's closing price, where changes exceeding 2% are labeled as "Buy," decreases beyond 2% as "Sell," and changes within Â±2% as "Hold." The notebook utilizes data from Binance and Yahoo Finance APIs, preprocessing steps, model selection, training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.


## Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, `binance.client`, `yfinance`, `dotenv`, and etc.
2.  **Load Data:**
    * **Binance API:** Retrieves historical Klines (candlestick data) and funding rates for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT). It loads API keys from a `.env` file (you need to create this file with your Binance API key and secret). See the [Binance API documentation](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api) for details.
    * **Yahoo Finance API:** Fetches additional historical data for BTC-USD using the `yfinance` library.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the combined data for modeling. This involves:
    * Handling missing values (using forward fill).
    * Feature engineering:
        * Extracting features from the timestamp.
        * Calculating various technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, ATR).
    * Scaling numerical features using `MinMaxScaler`.
    * Splitting   the data into training and testing sets. **The data is split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.**
4.  **Model Selection:** The notebook implements and evaluates several machine learning models for classification problem:
    * **Decision Tree Classifier**
    * **Random Forest Classifier**
    * **XGBoost Clssifier**
    * **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network**
        The performance of each model is compared based on evaluation metrics.
5.  **Model Training:** Code to train each of the selected models using the training data. The LSTM model involves specific data reshaping for sequential input.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the trained models on the testing data using *classification* metrics. The notebook calculates and prints metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and also includes a confusion matrix to analyze the classification performance.
7.  **Results and Visualization:**
    * Display   of the *classification* evaluation metrics for all tested models
    * Confusion   matrix to visualize the classification accuracy.
8.  **Conclusion:** A summary of the model performance.

## How to Use

To run this notebook, you will need:

* **Python 3** installed on your system.
* The following Python libraries (you can install them using pip):

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn binance-python yfinance python-dotenv tensorflow
    ```
* A **Binance account** and your **API key and secret**.

    * If you don't have a Binance account, you can sign up here: [Binance Registration](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register).
    * After signing up, you can find instructions on how to generate API keys in the Binance API documentation: [Binance API](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api). Look for the "How to Get Started" or "API Keys" section.
* Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the notebook (or adjust the path in the "Load Data" section) and store your Binance API credentials:

    ```
    BINANCE_API_KEY=YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY
    BINANCE_API_SECRET=YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET
    ```

**Steps:**

1.  Clone or download this repository (if applicable).
2.  Ensure the `.env` file with your Binance API credentials is correctly set up.
3.  Open the `btc_prediction_final.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4.  Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

## Potential Improvements

This section could outline potential areas for future work, such as:

* Further hyperparameter tuning for the models.
* Exploring more advanced time series models or deep learning architectures (e.g., Transformer networks).
* Incorporating sentiment analysis or other external data sources.
* Implementing cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
* Developing a trading strategy based on the predictions.
